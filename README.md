# satriales-pork-store

**Disclaimer:** this is a student project, with the goal to be _just_ a showcase for this developer's skills in React, Node, Typescript, and Javascript.

Welcome to **Satriale's Pork Store** repository website, a place where you can acquire your finest meats (and _just_ meats, we swear). But, we have to be sincere: our project is until under development. But is getting beautiful, and, if you want, you can clone this repository and check it out.

At the end of the development, this website will be divided into two parts: the first one, a user-friendly set of pages to showcase Satriale's incredible products; the second one, a management system to, guess what, manage the said website.
